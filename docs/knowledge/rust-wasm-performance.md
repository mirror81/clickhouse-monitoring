# Rust and WASM Performance

## Decision

Keep object-heavy transforms in TypeScript. Use Rust/WASM only for JSON-preserving or byte/string-heavy paths where data can stay serialized across the JS/WASM boundary.

> **Object-pivot WASM path is benchmark-only (issue #2150).** The user-event pivot runs in pure TS (`apps/dashboard/src/lib/chart-data-transforms/transforms/user-events.ts` → `transformUserEventCounts`). The dead TS wrapper `transformUserEventCountsWasm` was removed; the Rust exports `transform_user_event_counts_v2` / `_v3` remain only for `scripts/benchmarks/` and are not called by the app. Fully removing them requires rebuilding the committed `.wasm` binary — a follow-up for a maintainer who can run the wasm build.

Do not promote native Rust subprocess transforms into hot API paths. Process startup and IPC overhead dominate the benchmark for small and medium inputs.

## Why

Benchmark evidence from PR #1021 showed:
- JSONEachRow normalization reached roughly parity to 1.2x faster
- User-event object pivots were much slower in WASM v1/v2/v3
- Rust CLI subprocess transforms not viable for hot browser/API paths

## How to Apply

- Re-run `bun run scripts/bench-wasm.ts` after changing `rust/monitor-core`, `packages/clickhouse-client/src/wasm/monitor-core.ts`, or `scripts/bench-wasm.ts`
- Keep the promotion threshold at 1.20x
- Preserve lazy loading for the WASM bundle — do not add it to default dashboard or client bundles
- For `rust/ch-monitor-cli`, keep TUI refresh cadence bounded (one chart fetch every 5s)

## Latest Benchmark (May 1, 2026)

| Candidate | Size | TS ms | Candidate ms | Speedup | Promote |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| clickhouse-jsoneachrow-to-objects | large | 183.30 | 205.58 | 0.89x | no |
| clickhouse-jsoneachrow-to-json | large | 188.25 | 158.73 | 1.19x | no |
| chart-api-response-envelope | large | 190.31 | 164.56 | 1.16x | no |
| clickhouse-jsoneachrow-native-cli | large | 176.85 | 148.65 | 1.19x | no |

## Artifacts

- `scripts/bench-wasm.ts` — benchmark runner
- `scripts/build-wasm.ts` — WASM build script
- `rust/monitor-core` — Rust source
- `packages/clickhouse-client/src/wasm/monitor-core.ts` — JS bindings
- `packages/clickhouse-client/src/wasm/generated/monitor_core_bg.wasm` — compiled WASM
